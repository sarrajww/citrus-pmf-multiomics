  summary: >
    This study decodes the biosynthetic pathway for polymethoxylated flavonoids (PMFs)
    in Chenpi (Citrus reticulata cv. Chachiensis) using a chromosome-level genome assembly
    integrated with transcriptomics, metabolomics, and co-expression network analysis.
    A high-quality reference genome (~[NEED size] Mb, [NEED chromosome count] pseudochromosomes)
    was produced and anchored gene-metabolite correlations identified key O-methyltransferase
    (OMT) and CYP450 enzyme candidates. Functional validation via heterologous expression
    confirmed enzymatic activities for prioritized candidates, establishing a mechanistic
    foundation for PMF engineering in medicinal citrus.
